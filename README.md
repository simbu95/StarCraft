# StarCraft

This is some light work I have done for programming an GUI interface that works to assist a player in the game of StarCraft.

The Java code is used to run an interface, while the Cpp program actually runs the Starcraft enironment and uses the sc2api to command the game. A simple text communication is used to tie the two together. 

Further details for each section is given in their respective folders.
